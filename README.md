# Summary

The Chinese Philosophy curriculum is a complete education in Chinese Philosophy using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core

These sections form the backbone of the field. Complete them in the numbered order below before moving to any specialization. They give you the historical context, key texts, and major schools needed to understand Chinese philosophy as a coherent tradition.

I. Orientation: What “Chinese Philosophy” Is: Start here. It prevents common misunderstandings right from the beginning.

II. Historical & Textual Foundations: Extremely important. Learn how the classical Chinese language works and how texts were written, transmitted, and interpreted. Without this foundation, primary texts in later sections will be much harder to read meaningfully.

III. The Classical Philosophical Schools (Warring States): The heart of the tradition. Study all four subsections (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, Legalism) in any order within this section, but do not skip any of them.

IV. Cosmology & Natural Philosophy: Builds directly on the classical schools and is necessary to understand almost everything that comes after the Warring States period.

Neo-Confucian Metaphysics: The mature synthesis of the entire tradition up to the Song–Ming period. This is the high point of classical Chinese philosophical thinking for most modern readers.

Once you have completed sections I → IV → VIII in that sequence, you will have a coherent, well-rounded undergraduate-level grasp of Chinese philosophy.
