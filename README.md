## How to use this curriculum

### Core

These sections form the backbone of the field. Complete them in the numbered order below before moving to any specialization. They give you the historical context, key texts, and major schools needed to understand Chinese philosophy as a coherent tradition.

**I. Orientation: What “Chinese Philosophy” Is**: Start here. It prevents common misunderstandings right from the beginning.

**II. Historical & Textual Foundations**: Extremely important. Learn how the classical Chinese language works and how texts were written, transmitted, and interpreted. Without this foundation, primary texts in later sections will be much harder to read meaningfully.

**III. The Classical Philosophical Schools (Warring States)**: The heart of the tradition. Study all four subsections (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, Legalism) in any order within this section, but do not skip any of them.

**IV. Cosmology & Natural Philosophy**: Builds directly on the classical schools and is necessary to understand almost everything that comes after the Warring States period.

**VIII. Neo-Confucian Metaphysics**: The mature synthesis of the entire tradition up to the Song–Ming period. This is the high point of classical Chinese philosophical thinking for most modern readers.

Once you have completed sections I → IV → VIII in that sequence, you will have a coherent, well-rounded undergraduate-level grasp of Chinese philosophy.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are deeper dives or branch extensions. You do **not** need to study all of them. Pick 1–3 tracks that interest you most **after** finishing the core path.

- **V. Han Synthesis** → Interested in how Confucianism became a state ideology and cosmology?
- **VI. Buddhism Enters China** → Want to understand how Indian Buddhism was transformed in China and gave rise to Chan (Zen)?
- **VII. Medieval Daoism** → Curious about religious Daoism and its later metaphysical developments?
- **IX. Ethics & Moral Psychology** → Want to focus on contemporary relevance of Confucian virtue ethics and emotional cultivation?
- **X. Language, Logic & Epistemology** → Interested in technical questions about language, reasoning, and knowledge in Chinese thought?
- **XI. Comparative Philosophy** → Want to actively compare Chinese philosophy with Western or other global traditions?
